# Claude Assistance for JobSort AI

This document provides guidance for using Claude AI to assist with the development and enhancement of the JobSort AI project.

## Overview

JobSort AI is a web application that uses AI to analyze job descriptions and candidate resumes to determine match scores and provide recommendations for hiring decisions. The application has a modern, user-friendly interface built with Next.js and tailored to provide a seamless experience for HR professionals and recruiters.

## How Claude Can Help

### 1. Resume and Job Description Analysis

Claude can be used to:

- Extract key skills, qualifications, and requirements from job descriptions
- Identify important elements in candidate resumes (education, experience, skills)
- Generate compatibility scores between job descriptions and resumes
- Provide reasoning for why certain candidates match or don't match job requirements

Example prompt:
```
Given this job description:
[JOB DESCRIPTION TEXT]

And this candidate resume:
[RESUME TEXT]

Please analyze the compatibility between them. Focus on:
1. Required skills match
2. Experience level match
3. Education requirements
4. Location considerations
5. Overall fit

Provide a percentage score and detailed breakdown of strengths and gaps.
```

### 2. UI/UX Improvements

Claude can suggest UI/UX improvements by:

- Reviewing current interface designs
- Suggesting layout optimizations for better usability
- Providing ideas for visualizing match scores and results
- Offering language improvements for clearer communication

Example prompt:
```
I'd like to improve the results display in our resume matching application. Currently, we show:
[DESCRIPTION OF CURRENT DISPLAY]

Could you suggest 3-5 improvements to make the results more intuitive, actionable, and helpful for recruiters? Consider both visual design and information architecture.
```

### 3. Code Generation and Review

Claude can assist with:

- Generating React component code for new features
- Reviewing existing code for bugs or optimization opportunities
- Creating TypeScript interfaces and types
- Suggesting testing strategies and test cases

Example prompt:
```
I need to create a new React component for displaying skill matches between a job and resume. The component should:
- Show each skill from the job description
- Indicate whether the candidate has the skill
- Show a confidence score (0-100%)
- Visually highlight missing critical skills

Please generate a TypeScript React component with appropriate props interface.
```

### 4. Documentation and Planning

Claude can help with:

- Writing or improving technical documentation
- Creating user guides and help content
- Developing project roadmaps and feature priorities
- Breaking down complex features into development tasks

Example prompt:
```
We're planning to add a new feature that allows users to compare multiple candidates side-by-side against a job description. Could you help:
1. Write a detailed feature specification
2. Break this down into development tasks with time estimates
3. Suggest any potential technical challenges
4. Outline testing requirements
```

## Best Practices for Working with Claude

1. **Provide Context**: Always give Claude sufficient background about the project and specific component you're working on.

2. **Be Specific**: Clearly define what you need help with and specify constraints (e.g., using specific libraries or following certain patterns).

3. **Iterative Refinement**: Use follow-up questions to refine Claude's responses until they match your needs.

4. **Code Review**: Always review code generated by Claude before implementing it, especially checking for security best practices.

5. **Ethical Considerations**: Ensure all AI-generated content respects privacy, avoids bias, and follows ethical guidelines for recruitment tools.
